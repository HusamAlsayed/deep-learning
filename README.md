# deep-learning
in this repo i will share some of the deep learning model that i made , hopefully with some mathematical explination





Text  Gender Classification .

in this project i build a deep learning model which aims to distinguish between the male and female based on some tweets taken from Twitter . 


how ever , the project need some extra analysis , and it would be better if i trained it in a reliable dataset rather than these own who is based on some Celebraties account , another way to express this thing could be to read the actual photo or url and further analyse them , so one can make image caption and add the generated text to the actual tweet .


the dataset is calculated By :

Eyad Abu Km .
